					Page layouts are set of pre-made layouts that can be used as the starter on any page/app design.
					While they provide some styling by default, it's very minimal and can be easily modified from the
					component you create.

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Consistency</strong>
						</p>
						Your apps and pages will all look similar in terms of layout and general styling which
						essentially make them more user friendly and easy to learn.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Easy modifications</strong>
						</p>
						In the future, if you decide to change the design of your pages, add elements or modify the
						existing ones, it can be done very easily since all your pages will be sharing same class names
						and the general code structure.

					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Easier learning curve for your users</strong>
						</p>
						Making the general design and layout of your pages similar will make them easier to learn for
						your users. They won't be looking for a save button or a search field over and over again,
						trying to find and memorize their locations for each page since all pages will be sharing a
						similar structure.
