						As per the official page of Tailwind CSS, it is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework
						that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying
						opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

					<Typography className="mb-4">
						To simply put, Tailwind provides helper classes for almost every CSS rule available. Fuse
						includes and uses Tailwind by default and it can be used in any part of the theme.

					<Typography

						We are accepting JSS advantages but we can't leave <b>helper classes</b> for fast development,
						ease of use, globally access etc. So we have used both in components.

							TailwindCSS

						as an engine for generating helper classes. It's not an UI kit and it's customizable. You can
